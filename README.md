FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz program.  
This program is designed to produce a list of numbers from 1 to 100.  
Within the lines (numbers) output, for every number divisible by 3, the output will, instead, be "Fizz" rather than the number.  
Similarly, if the number is divisible by 5, then the output will be "buzz."  
Lastly, if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then the output will be "fizzbuzz."  

The logic behind this program is as follows:  

First, the program needs to count from number 1 to 100.
The program will need to calculate if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or (3 and 5).
There would be a testing phase:  
If the number is not evenly divisible by 3, 5, or (3 and 5), then the number will be the value displayed.  
If the number is divisible by 3, but not 5, then the word "fizz" would be displayed.
If the number is divisible by 5, but not 3, then the word "buzz" would be displayed.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then the word "fizzbuzz" would be displayed.
The testing phase is completed for each number while going from 1 to 100.
After the last number (100) is handled, then the program will conclude.
